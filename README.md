Welcome to the **Codsoft Internship Python Programmer**!ðŸŒŸ
## Developer Information
**Name:** Balaji Gopal Naidu  
**Company:** CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS  
**ID:** CT08WRK 
**Domain:** PYTHON PROGRAMMING  
**Duration:** Feb 25 to March 25 

Here, you'll find a showcase of my journey and achievements during the internship, featuring hands-on projects that delve into various facets of Python Language. Dive into the realm of predictive analytics and classification with the following projects:

## Projects

### 1. **MACHINE LEARNING MODEL IMPLEMENTATION** ðŸ“ˆ
- **Description:** This project analyzes the famous Iris dataset using a Random Forest Classifier and presents results through attractive visualizations.
- **Highlights:**
** Steps in the Code:**

**Data Loading & Preparation**

Load the Iris dataset and convert target labels to categorical names (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica).
Display the first few rows for quick inspection.

**Data Visualization ðŸ“Š**

Pairplot: Shows relationships between features using KDE density shading.
Confusion Matrix: Visualized using a heatmap with the "magma" color scheme.
Feature Importance: Displayed using a bar chart with a gradient color effect.

**Data Splitting & Model Training ðŸ¤–**

Split the dataset into 80% training and 20% testing.
Train a Random Forest Classifier with 120 trees and a max depth of 5.

**Model Evaluation âœ…**

Calculate accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
Accuracy is printed for performance assessment.

**Enhanced Visuals ðŸŽ¨**

Seaborn styling (darkgrid) for modern aesthetics.
Bigger, bolder fonts for readability.
Grid lines and color gradients for improved clarity.

Feel free to explore the code, datasets, and documentation provided in each project. Your feedback and insights are greatly appreciated as I continue to refine and expand my skills in the dynamic field of Python Programming. Happy coding! ðŸš€ðŸ“Š
